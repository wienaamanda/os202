# Top 10 List of Week 00

1. [Learn how to create github pages](https://pages.github.com/)<br>
Sebelumnya saya belum pernah membuat github page, namun setelah membaca beberapa referensi ternyata membuat github page tidaklah sulit. Cukup membuat github repository dan setting lalu pilih source dan tema yang diinginkan.

2. [Markdown Command](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)<br>
Saya membaca referensi mengenai markdown command dimana untuk bekal dalam menuliskan github pages, selain itu kita dapat melakukan styling font seperti membuat tulisan italic, bold dan juga membuat link text yang akan melakukan routing ke link yang diinginkan.

3. [Git basic command](http://guides.beanstalkapp.com/version-control/common-git-commands.html)<br>
I learned about the basic git command for operating system courses. I've used gitlab before, so I'm familiar with the commands on github, some basic command : git commit, git push dan git pull.

4. [What is an operating system?](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/understanding-operating-systems/1/)<br>
An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. Without an operating system, a computer is useless.

5. [Role and Purpose of operating system](https://homepage.cs.uri.edu/faculty/wolfe/book/Readings/Reading07.htm)<br>
An operating system has three main functions: (1) manage the computer's resources, such as the central processing unit, memory, disk drives, and printers, (2) establish a user interface, and (3) execute and provide services for applications software.

6. [Memory Manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdkxXygc3rE)<br>
Memory manager is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution. Memory manager ensures that a program does not interfere with memory already in use by another program. 

7. [Virtual memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlH4-oHnBb8)<br>
Virtual memory take program addresses and maps them to RAM address

8. [Microkernel](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/microkernel-in-operating-systems/)<br>
Kernel is the core part of an operating system which manages system resources. It also acts like a bridge between application and hardware of the computer. It is one of the first programs loaded on start-up (after the Bootloader).

9. [Interrupt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt)<br>
interrupt is a response by the processor to an event that needs attention from the software. An interrupt condition alerts the processor and serves as a request for the processor to interrupt the currently executing code when permitted, so that the event can be processed in a timely manner.

10. [API](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api)<br>
API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, youâ€™re using an API.
