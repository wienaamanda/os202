4. [What is an operating system?](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/understanding-operating-systems/1/)<br>
An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. Without an operating system, a computer is useless.

5. [Git basic command](http://guides.beanstalkapp.com/version-control/common-git-commands.html)<br>
I learned about the basic git command for operating system courses. I've used gitlab before, so I'm familiar with the commands on github.

6. [Purpose of operating system](https://homepage.cs.uri.edu/faculty/wolfe/book/Readings/Reading07.htm)<br>
An operating system has three main functions: (1) manage the computer's resources, such as the central processing unit, memory, disk drives, and printers, (2) establish a user interface, and (3) execute and provide services for applications software.

7. [Interrupt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt)<br>
interrupt is a response by the processor to an event that needs attention from the software. An interrupt condition alerts the processor and serves as a request for the processor to interrupt the currently executing code when permitted, so that the event can be processed in a timely manner.

8. [Microkernel](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/microkernel-in-operating-systems/)<br>
Kernel is the core part of an operating system which manages system resources. It also acts like a bridge between application and hardware of the computer. It is one of the first programs loaded on start-up (after the Bootloader).

9. [Memory Manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdkxXygc3rE)<br>
Memory manager is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution. Memory manager ensures that a program does not interfere with memory already in use by another program. 

10. [Virtual memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlH4-oHnBb8)<br>
Virtual memory take program addresses and maps them to RAM address
