# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [Cooperating Processes](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cooperating-process#)<br>
Cooperating processes are those that can affect or are affected by other processes running on the system. Cooperating processes may share data with each other.

2. [Race Condition](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/race-condition-critical-section-and-semaphore#)<br>
A race condition is a situation that may occur inside a critical section. This happens when the result of multiple thread execution in critical section differs according to the order in which the threads execute

3. [Peterson's Solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/petersons-algorithm-in-process-synchronization/)<br>
Peterson's Solution is a classic software-based solution to the critical section problem. It is unfortunately not guaranteed to work on modern hardware, due to vagaries of load and store operations, but it illustrates a number of important concepts. On this page you will find the peterson's algorithm and the explantion of peterson's algorithm

4. [Semaphore](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/semaphores-in-process-synchronization/)<br>
Semaphore is simply a variable which is non-negative and shared between threads. This variable is used to solve the critical section problem and to achieve process synchronization in the multiprocessing environment. On this page you will find two types of semaphores and the explanation of each types.

5. [Clasical Problems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classical-problems-of-synchronization-with-semaphore-solution/)<br>
These problems are used for testing nearly every newly proposed synchronization scheme. The following problems of synchronization are considered as classical problems, such as Bounded-buffer (or Producer-Consumer) Problem, Dining-Philosphers Problem, Readers and Writers Problem and Sleeping Barber Problem. On this page you will find the summarized of the problems.

6. [Deadlock Characterization](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/deadlock-characterization)<br>
A deadlock happens in operating system when two or more processes need some resource to complete their execution that is held by the other process. A deadlock occurs if the four Coffman conditions hold true. But these conditions are not mutually exclusive. They are given as follows Mutual Exclusion, Hold and Wait, No Preemption and Circular Wait. 
Halaman ini menarik karena setiap characterization dijelaskan dengan ringkas dan dilengkapi dengan gambar yang membuatnya semakin menarik.

7. [Deadlock Prevention](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deadlock-prevention/)<br>
We can prevent Deadlock by eliminating deadlock characterization. Di website ini menjelaskan 4 deadlock prevention secara lengkap yang membuat website ini menarik.

8. [Resource and Allocation Graph](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/resource-allocation-graph-rag-in-operating-system/)<br>
The resource allocation graph is the pictorial representation of the state of a system. As its name suggests, the resource allocation graph is the complete information about all the processes which are holding some resources or waiting for some resources. This page is loads with images that make the website attractive.

9. [Bounded Waiting](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/5_Synchronization.html)<br>
As each process enters their entry section, they set the turn variable to be the other processes turn. Since no process ever sets it back to their own turn, this ensures that each process will have to let the other process go first at most one time before it becomes their turn again

10. [Banker's Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bankers-algorithm-in-operating-system-2/)<br>
The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “s-state” check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue. Pada halaman ini memuat juga contoh dari banker's algorithm sehingga lebih mudah dimengerti.
